# Code Assist attempts

I stagger in with the following copy & pasted out of Sheets
```
postal_region fic_name  fic_author  is_locked fandom  rating  word_count  row page_count  paper_size  imposer_settings  screenshot_1  screenshot_2  screenshot_3  blurb Notes colab_level fic_url address discord name
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
```

I ask the Assistant

> I have two lists. One of names and one of numbers. I need them to be assigned so that the number is the index in an array named "data"
> the lists are:
> postal_region fic_name  fic_author  is_locked fandom  rating  word_count  row page_count  paper_size  imposer_settings  screenshot_1  screenshot_2  screenshot_3  blurb Notes colab_level fic_url address discord name
> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20

Assistant 

> Got it. It looks like your data is structured as a table with multiple columns. To clarify, are you saying you have a list of names and a list of numbers, but each list corresponds to a specific column in this table-like structure? If so, could you specify which column contains the names and which column contains the numbers?

> the first row is variable name, the second row is index in array


```
const variableNames = ["postal_region", "fic_name", "fic_author", "is_locked", "fandom", "rating", "word_count", "row", "page_count", "paper_size", "imposer_settings", "screenshot_1", "screenshot_2", "screenshot_3", "blurb", "Notes", "colab_level", "fic_url", "address", "discord", "name"];
const indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20];

// Create an empty data array
const data = [];

// Assign variables to the data array based on indices
indices.forEach((index, i) => {
    data[index] = variableNames[i];
});

console.log(data);
```

It doesn't matter whether it's right or not-- I immediately realize that I've asked for the wrong thing. My question was wrong.

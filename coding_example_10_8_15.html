<!--
The first step in our hiring process is that weâ€™d like to have you do a small coding exercise to give us a feel for how you code. The exercise is to create a simple visualization using HTML5 and JavaScript.

Please time yourself to up to two hours and get as far as you can on the following:
HTML5 Canvas Square
  [x] create a 300x300 pixel Canvas object
  [x] render a 40x40 pixel square into the Canvas object
  [x] make the square draggable.
(Target the most recent stable release of the Chrome browser.)

All the code you write should be your own code. Don't use any existing frameworks to complete this task. It is fine to use architectural patterns **adapted** from existing frameworks or online examples in your own code.

Apply what you think are good UI patterns/conventions for the dragging operation.

Please send us your code (posting it online for us to view is best) after working on it for up to two hours, along with a description of how your code works and what architectural patterns and/or frameworks inspired your work. Please let us know what time you started and stopped the test
